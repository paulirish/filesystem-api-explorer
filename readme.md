## FileSystem API Explorer

### Show files stored with the File System API.

A helper extension which help developers browse into the contents of their local Web filesystem created by FileSystem API.  After installing the extension, visit a Web site that uses FileSystem API (like HTML5Rocks' FileSystem tutorial page http://playground.html5rocks.com/#filesystem_apis) and click the browser action icon.

With the extension you can browse the contents of the Web FileSystem used by the site (like you do with explorer on your local disk), and also can see how much more your app can store in the FileSystem (see "Remaining space" on the top of the popup).
